Use ATlauncher to play, other launchers are supported but may have problems or changes in the step-by-step.

To install the modpack, follow these steps:

1. [Download this.](https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz-installer-bootstrap/releases).
2. Create an ATlauncher instance for 1.20.1 with NeoForge.
3. Go to the instance settings and then to the commands tab.
4. Allow commands and add this command line to the pre-launch: `"$INST_JAVA" -jar packwiz-installer-bootstrap.jar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seriousfreezing/Cashworks/main/packwiz/pack.toml`
5. Add these two mods externally: [EntityCulling](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/DHBIGCNn/entityculling-forge-1.6.6-mc1.20.1.jar), [Physics](https://www.patreon.com/file?h=105510754&i=19422295)
6. You're ready to play!
